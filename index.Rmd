## The Motor Trend Dataset

- The motor trend dataset (mtcars) is a build in dataset in R.
It contains fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles.

- Let's load the dataset into R and look at the first three observations:
```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars,3)
```

- We will build a tool that allows exploratory analysis of the mtcars dataset
